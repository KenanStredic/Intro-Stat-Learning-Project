# Intro-Stat-Learning-Projects
For multiple projects in the Introduction to Statistical Learning Course, I used R and Python to run data analysis on numerous datasets.
During this analysis, I used supervised learning methods such as:
- Linear Regression
- Classification
- Cross-validation
- Bootstrap
- Model Selection and Regularization
- Tree-based methods
- Support vector machines

I also used unsupervised learning methods such as:
- Principal Components Analysis
- Clustering
